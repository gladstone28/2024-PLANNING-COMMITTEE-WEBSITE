Creating a complete website for the King's Gate United Church Planning Committee involves several steps. To meet your criteria, we'll design a simple website structure using HTML, style it with CSS for responsiveness, and add interactive elements with JavaScript. The website will include:

1. Responsive Design: Using CSS media queries.
2. Interactive Elements: JavaScript for accordion/collapsible sections.
3. Navigation Bar: Easy access to different sections.
4. Search Functionality: JavaScript for a basic search feature.
5. Multimedia Content: HTML tags for embedding images and videos.
6. Footer: Contact and social media information.
7. FAQ Section: A simple FAQ layout.

Note:
- Accordion/Collapsible Elements: You should add the HTML for each event in the #events section using <button class="accordion">Event Title</button> followed by <div class="panel">Event Details</div>.
- Search Functionality: This requires additional JavaScript to implement and will depend on the structure of your content.
- Multimedia Content: Use <img> tags for images and <iframe> for embedding videos.
- Footer & FAQ: Add relevant content in the respective sections.
- This is a basic structure and needs to be expanded upon based on specific requirements, content, and styles. Remember to test the website on various devices to ensure responsiveness and usability.

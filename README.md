Creating a complete website for the King's Gate United Church Planning Committee involves several steps. To meet your criteria, we'll design a simple website structure using HTML, style it with CSS for responsiveness, and add interactive elements with JavaScript. The website will include:

1. Responsive Design: Using CSS media queries.
2. Interactive Elements: JavaScript for accordion/collapsible sections.
3. Navigation Bar: Easy access to different sections.
4. Search Functionality: JavaScript for a basic search feature.
5. Multimedia Content: HTML tags for embedding images and videos.
6. Footer: Contact and social media information.
7. FAQ Section: A simple FAQ layout.

Note:
- Accordion/Collapsible Elements: You should add the HTML for each event in the #events section using <button class="accordion">Event Title</button> followed by <div class="panel">Event Details</div>.
- Search Functionality: This requires additional JavaScript to implement and will depend on the structure of your content.
- Multimedia Content: Use <img> tags for images and <iframe> for embedding videos.
- Footer & FAQ: Add relevant content in the respective sections.
- This is a basic structure and needs to be expanded upon based on specific requirements, content, and styles. Remember to test the website on various devices to ensure responsiveness and usability.

Can you give me example HTML for the Accordion/Collapsible Elements?

ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's an example of how you might set up accordion/collapsible elements in HTML for the events section. This example includes two events, but you can replicate the structure for as many events as needed.


> 

<section id="events">
    <h2>Upcoming Events</h2>

    <button class="accordion">Event 1: Summer Retreat</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Date: July 15th, 2024</p>
        <p>Location: Mountain View Retreat Center</p>
        <p>Description: Join us for a weekend of fellowship, worship, and rejuvenation at our annual summer retreat. Activities include hiking, workshops, and worship sessions.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Event 2: Charity Concert</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Date: September 10th, 2024</p>
        <p>Location: King's Gate Auditorium</p>
        <p>Description: An evening of music and community. All proceeds will go towards local charities. Featuring performances by local artists and church choirs.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Add more events in the same format as above -->
</section>


### Explanation:
- Each event is represented by a <button> element with the class accordion. This is what users will click to toggle the visibility of the event details.
- The <div> element following each button with the class panel contains the details of the event. This content will be hidden by default and will only be shown when the corresponding button is clicked.
- You can add as many event sections as needed by replicating the <button> and <div> structure.
- Remember to include the CSS and JavaScript provided in the previous message to ensure that the accordion functionality works properly. The JavaScript will make these sections collapsible, and the CSS will style them appropriately.

Search Functionality: This requires additional JavaScript to implement and will depend on the structure of your content. Can you give me example code of this function?

### ChatGPT
Sure, I can provide you with an example of how to implement a basic search functionality using JavaScript. This functionality will allow users to search for events in the accordion/collapsible sections you have on your webpage.

First, you'll need to add a search bar in your HTML where users can input their search queries:

>

<div id="search-container">
    <input type="text" id="search-input" placeholder="Search events...">
    <button onclick="searchEvents()">Search</button>
</div>

Next, you will need JavaScript to handle the search functionality. This script will look for the text the user inputs in the search bar, compare it with the text in your accordion sections, and then display only the sections that match the search query.

function searchEvents() {
    let input = document.getElementById('search-input').value;
    input = input.toLowerCase();
    let x = document.getElementsByClassName('accordion');

    for (i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
        if (!x[i].innerHTML.toLowerCase().includes(input)) {
            x[i].style.display="none";
            x[i].nextElementSibling.style.display="none"; // Hides the panel as well
        } else {
            x[i].style.display="list-item"; 
            x[i].nextElementSibling.style.display="none"; // Keeps the panel hidden until clicked
        }
    }
}
